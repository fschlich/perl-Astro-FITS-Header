To Do

- Add ability for units to be extracted from item comments

- Read HISTORY from NDF and merge it into FITS header

- Provide option to extract WCS from FITS header and store it in AST object

- Support subheaders (ie those in Multi-extension fits files that are
  not part of the main header, or the headers in UKIRT data (.I1, .I2)
  [partly complete, reader should find subheaders automatically
  but at least the infrastructure now supports subheaders]

- Support MEF fits headers in a single object. Can use a special card
  type that will indicate a header change [possible with the name
  of the next subfile]. Could use "1_" prefix to reference the
  items from sub headers. [this is now part of the subheader support
  described above]
